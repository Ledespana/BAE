      <p>
        Any text message that you send, will receive a score from 0 to 1 depending on your state of happiness.
        Our software will classify them in <strong>"Positive"</strong> (more than 0.65),
        <strong>"Neutral"</strong>(more than 0.25) or <strong>"Negative"</strong>(less than 0.25).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are adding a keyword or a combination of keyword, make sure to know
        that you are adding them with the right sentiment, so you will get the response
        only if you are actually in that state of happiness.
