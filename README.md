### Ruby version

*2.2.3*

###  Description

BAE is a platform for users to create a personalized bot(bae) that maintains a conversation with the user over the phone. By implementing an algorithm and database, the bot interprets the userâ€™s texts and responds with the perfect answer for the user and his state of happiness.

Built using modern software development techniques such as TDD and "Fat model, skinny controller". Languages used were Ruby, JavaScript and SQL. Software and tools were Ruby on Rails, TDD, Github, Twilio, Indico, and PostgreSQL.

### Features

* User is able to create a bae with different attributes.

* Bae's avatar will be different depending of its attributes.

* User has a vocabulary page with all the interactions

* User can add interactions to his vocabulary

* User can edit/ delete interaction from his vocabulary

* Each interaction can be a sentence, a keyword or a combination of keywords. Custom validation for submitting at least one of them

* User can see a list of other users and their vocabularies

* User can add interactions from other vocabulary to his own vocabulary.

* User can see add//remove any of his interactions to his bae

* User can see his bae's interactions (bae's vocabulary page)

* When a user creates a bae, the new bae will send a welcome message to the user phone to start the conversation

* When a user replies a message, his bae will analyze the user state of happiness and the content of the message and depending on that it will return a different response

* The user message will get an score from 0 to 1 depending of the state of happiness.
  If its less than 0.25 the message will be considered with a "Negative" sentiment.
  If it between 0.25 and 0.65 the message will be considered with a "Neutral" sentiment.
  If it grader than 0.65 the message will be considered with a "Positive" sentiment.

* When a bae gets a response and analyse the sentiment, it will look through the user's message for a whole sentence, a keyword or a combination of keywords in the database in order to give the response attached to that specific interaction found with the same sentiment.
